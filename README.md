Frontend web development project made as a part of a competition. 
The project is about a website which connects several multiplayer games at one place making it easy for players to find all major famous games at one platform. 
The idea behind the website is to make it easy for players to make all video games available at one place so that don't have to search different sites. 
Currently, just the UI part of the website is designed but further we can take this site to its next level by adding backend and database and can actually make it a live working site where real users can register and will be contacted 
accordingly. 
Virtual collaboration tournaments of various games can be held.
